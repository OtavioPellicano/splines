Splines is a library for 3D curves interpolation in spherical coordinates. This kind of interpolation is massively used in Oil & Gas field in
applications such as following the string position or in efforts calculation. The library is fully implemented in C++, but there is a Python 3
interface for a more convenient and simpler use.

Interpolations Currently Supported
=================================

- Linear
- Cubic
- Minimum Curvature
